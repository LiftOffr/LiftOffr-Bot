# Advanced Cryptocurrency Trading Bot Report

## System Overview

This advanced cryptocurrency trading bot leverages sophisticated machine learning techniques to trade 9 cryptocurrency pairs on the Kraken US exchange. The system combines multiple independent trading strategies that share portfolio resources, with each strategy limited to 0-1 open trades at any time.

## Key Features

### Machine Learning Architecture
- **Multi-timeframe Approach**: Models trained on 6 timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
- **Specialized Models**: Separate models for entry timing, exit timing, position sizing, and trade cancellation
- **Ensemble Predictions**: Combines predictions from multiple models for robust decision-making
- **Advanced Neural Networks**: Hybrid architectures utilizing CNN, LSTM, and TCN components

### Risk Management
- **Dynamic Risk Settings**: Risk parameters adjust automatically based on prediction confidence
- **Portfolio-wide Protection**: Cross-strategy exits with configurable thresholds
- **Maximum Loss Cutoff**: 4% maximum percentage loss regardless of ATR values
- **Signal Strength Arbitration**: Stronger signals trump weaker ones when strategies conflict
- **Trailing Stops**: Protect profits while allowing trades to run

### Strategy Organization
- **Dual Strategy Categories**: "Those dudes" and "Him all along" strategy groups
- **Trend Detection**: Avoid taking shorts in uptrends using EMA50/EMA100
- **Multi-cryptocurrency Support**: 9 pairs (SOL/USD, BTC/USD, ETH/USD, ADA/USD, DOT/USD, LINK/USD, AVAX/USD, MATIC/USD, UNI/USD)
- **Dual Limit Orders**: Improved fill rates for both entries and exits
