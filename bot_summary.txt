# Kraken Trading Bot: Strategy Summary

## ARIMA Strategy Implementation

The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) strategy uses time series forecasting to predict future price movements and make trading decisions based on these predictions.

### Key Components

1. **Time Series Forecasting**
   - Uses ARIMA model from statsmodels to predict price movements
   - Parameters: p=1, d=1, q=0 (default)
   - Forecasts next price based on historical data

2. **Risk Management**
   - ATR (Average True Range) for volatility assessment
   - Trailing stops based on ATR multiples
   - Risk buffer multiplier to prevent liquidation
   - Entry price offset for limit orders

3. **Entry Signals**
   - Buy when forecast is higher than current price (bullish)
   - Sell when forecast is lower than current price (bearish)
   - Entry orders placed as limit orders with small ATR offset

4. **Exit Signals**
   - Trailing stop based on ATR multiple (default: 4x ATR)
   - Updated as price moves favorably
   - Implemented as exchange limit orders

### Parameters

- `lookback_period`: Number of periods for analysis (default: 32)
- `atr_trailing_multiplier`: Multiplier for ATR trailing stop (default: 4.0)
- `entry_atr_multiplier`: Multiplier for entry price offset (default: 0.01)
- `leverage`: Trading leverage (default: 30x)
- `risk_buffer_multiplier`: ATR buffer for liquidation protection (default: 1.25)
- `arima_order`: ARIMA model parameters (default: (1,1,0))

### Running the Strategy

The ARIMA strategy can be run using the included script:

```bash
./start_arima_trading.sh         # Run in sandbox mode
./start_arima_trading.sh --live  # Run in live trading mode
```

Or directly using Python:

```bash
python main.py --strategy arima --pair SOLUSD --sandbox
```

## Adaptive Strategy

This is the default multi-factor strategy that combines various technical indicators:

1. **Technical Indicators**
   - EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
   - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
   - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
   - ADX (Average Directional Index)
   - Bollinger Bands
   - Keltner Channels

2. **Entry Conditions**
   - Trend following with EMA crossovers
   - Momentum confirmation with RSI
   - Volatility assessment
   - Linear regression forecast

3. **Risk Management**
   - ATR-based position sizing
   - Dynamic trailing stops
   - Volatility filters

The adaptive strategy can be run using:

```bash
./start_live_trading.sh
```
