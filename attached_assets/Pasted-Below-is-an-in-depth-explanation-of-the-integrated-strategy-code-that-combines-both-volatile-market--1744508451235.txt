Below is an in‐depth explanation of the integrated strategy code that combines both volatile market indicators and an ARIMA‐style component into one single portfolio strategy. This explanation covers every parameter, value, and step in the code so that you can understand the rationale behind each piece and use it to implement a trading bot.

1. Overview of the Strategy Concept
This strategy is designed for a single-portfolio approach where multiple sub-strategies (or “signal generators”) compete to determine the market view. In this design:

Volatile Market Indicators:
These include technical indicators such as EMA, RSI, MACD, DMI/ADX, Bollinger Bands, and Keltner Channels. They are calculated on the current chart timeframe and are used to generate bullish or bearish “strength” values.

ARIMA Component:
Instead of a full-blown ARIMA forecasting model (which is difficult to implement exactly in Pine Script), the code uses a linear regression forecast on 45-minute data as an approximation of an ARIMA-style forecast. This forecast is compared to the 45-minute close to generate a strength index.

Strength Index and Signal Combination:
Each indicator (including the ARIMA part) produces a strength value—a normalized measure that indicates how strongly it signals a long or short view. Then, the strategy compares all bullish signals to pick the strongest bullish view and does the same for bearish signals. A final decision (either “long” or “short”) is made based on which side’s maximum strength is higher and exceeds a minimum threshold.

Entry and Override Rules:
If no position exists, the strongest signal triggers an entry. If a position is already open and a new, opposing signal emerges with a significantly higher strength, an override is executed (i.e., the current position is closed and the new trade is entered).

Risk Management & Exits:
The risk management structure includes a fixed stop loss (set as a multiple of the ATR), trailing stops, and a liquidation exit condition (to close trades if the price reaches a level near the theoretical liquidation price). These risk controls ensure that each position is managed with an eye toward preserving capital.

2. Inputs & Parameters
The user inputs in the strategy allow you to adjust the behavior without modifying the code. Here’s what each parameter does:

Common Risk and Order Parameters
leverage:

Type: Float

Default: 25.0

Purpose: This represents the leverage used in the position. It is critical for calculating liquidation levels and risk buffers.

liq_exit_offset_percent:

Type: Float

Default: 0.01 (or 1%)

Purpose: This is a small offset percentage used to adjust the theoretical liquidation price when deciding if an exit is necessary.

atrPeriod:

Type: Integer

Default: 14

Purpose: This defines the period over which the Average True Range (ATR) is computed. ATR is used for both risk management (e.g., setting stop loss levels) and for normalizing the strength indices.

fixed_stop_multiplier:

Type: Float

Default: 2.0

Purpose: This multiplier sets the fixed stop loss distance from the entry price in ATR multiples. For instance, a value of 2.0 means the stop loss is placed 2 ATRs away from the average entry price.

entry_offset_multiplier:

Type: Float

Default: 0.01

Purpose: For the volatile market signals, this multiplier provides a small offset when setting the entry price (either below or above the current price).

trail_atr_multiplier:

Type: Float

Default: 2.0

Purpose: This multiplier sets the trailing stop offset in ATR multiples.

vol_threshold:

Type: Float

Default: 0.006

Purpose: This threshold (expressed as a ratio of ATR to price) is used as an adaptive filter. Only when the market’s volatility is above this level do the signals become “active.”

min_strength:

Type: Float

Default: 0.1

Purpose: A minimum threshold for the normalized strength value. If the strongest view (bullish or bearish) does not reach this value, then no trade is taken.

ARIMA-Specific Parameters
arima_lookback:

Type: Integer

Default: 20

Purpose: Defines the number of bars (from the 45-minute data) to use for the linear regression forecast, which acts as an ARIMA signal.

arima_entry_offset_multiplier:

Type: Float

Default: 0.01

Purpose: Similar to the volatile entry offset multiplier but specifically for orders generated from the ARIMA component. It adjusts the optimal entry price calculated from 45-minute lows/highs.

3. Common Indicator Calculations
ATR (Average True Range)
Usage:

Calculated using the provided atrPeriod.

Used to normalize strength values and set risk management levels such as stop loss and trailing stops.

Volatile Market Indicators (Current Timeframe)
EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages):

ema9 and ema21 are used to gauge trend direction.

The difference between the two (in the correct order) is used to form part of the strength calculation.

RSI (Relative Strength Index):

rsi14 is used to qualify momentum.

Bullish conditions are defined for RSI between 45 and 75, and bearish when between 25 and 55.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):

macdLine and its signalLine are calculated.

Their difference, when positive or negative, provides a signal strength.

DMI/ADX (Directional Movement Index/Average Directional Index):

pDI and mDI represent the positive and negative directional indicators.

Along with adx_val, these indicate trend strength.

Bollinger Bands:

Computed from a 20-period simple moving average (basis) plus/minus twice the standard deviation (dev).

They provide dynamic support/resistance levels.

Keltner Channels:

kc_middle (based on a 20-period EMA) serves as a reference.

Although the upper and lower Keltner channels aren’t directly used in the entry logic, kc_middle helps to create conditions (e.g., price above or below it) in the strength calculations.

Adaptive Filter
Purpose:

The filter (atr14 / close) > vol_threshold ensures that the strength calculations only “turn on” when the market is exhibiting sufficient relative volatility.

If the market is too calm, the signals will effectively be zero.

ARIMA Indicators (45-minute Data)
45-Minute Price Data:

The script requests 45-minute data for close, low, and high using request.security.

Linear Regression Forecast:

Using the lookback period defined by arima_lookback, a linear regression forecast (with an offset of -1) is computed.

This forecast is compared to the current 45-minute close to generate a bullish or bearish signal strength.

4. Indicator-Based Strength Calculations
For each sub-strategy, a “strength” index is computed if its conditions are met:

EMA-Based Strength:

Bullish: If ema9 > ema21, the strength is (ema9 - ema21) / atr14.

Bearish: Conversely, if ema9 < ema21, the strength is (ema21 - ema9) / atr14.

RSI-Based Strength:

Bullish: If RSI is between 45 and 75, strength is calculated as (rsi14 - 45) / 30.0 (normalized to a 0–1 scale).

Bearish: If RSI is between 25 and 55, strength is (55 - rsi14) / 30.0.

MACD-Based Strength:

Bullish: If macdLine > signalLine, strength is (macdLine - signalLine) / atr14.

Bearish: If macdLine < signalLine, strength is (signalLine - macdLine) / atr14.

DMI/ADX-Based Strength:

Bullish: If pDI > mDI and ADX > 20, strength is (pDI - mDI) / adx_val.

Bearish: If mDI > pDI under similar conditions, strength is (mDI - pDI) / adx_val.

Bollinger Bands-Based Strength:

Bullish: If price is above the Keltner midpoint (kc_middle) but below the upper Bollinger Band (bb_upper), strength is (close - kc_middle) / atr14.

Bearish: If price is below kc_middle but above the lower Bollinger Band (bb_lower), strength is (kc_middle - close) / atr14.

Keltner Channels-Based Strength:

Bullish: If price is above kc_middle, strength is (close - kc_middle) / atr14.

Bearish: If price is below kc_middle, strength is (kc_middle - close) / atr14.

ARIMA-Based Strength:

Bullish: If the ARIMA forecast (arima_lrForecast) is greater than the 45-minute close (m45Close), strength is (arima_lrForecast - m45Close) / atr14.

Bearish: If the forecast is below the 45-minute close, strength is (m45Close - arima_lrForecast) / atr14.

Each strength is calculated only if the adaptive volatility condition is met. Otherwise, the strength remains zero.

5. Combining the Signals
The strategy then compares the strength values from all the sub-strategies:

For Bullish Signals:
The code finds the maximum bullish strength among EMA, RSI, MACD, DMI, Bollinger Bands, Keltner Channels, and ARIMA. It also records which indicator provided that maximum strength.

For Bearish Signals:
Similarly, the maximum bearish strength is determined.

Final Decision:

If the maximum bullish strength exceeds the maximum bearish strength and meets the minimum threshold (min_strength), the final signal is "long."

If the maximum bearish strength is higher and meets the threshold, the final signal is "short."

If neither side meets the minimum strength, the final signal remains "none," and no entry is taken.

6. Order Price Determination
Based on the final signal, two sets of order prices are calculated:

Volatile Order Prices (Current Timeframe):

Long Price: close - (entry_offset_multiplier * atr14)

Short Price: close + (entry_offset_multiplier * atr14)

ARIMA Order Prices (45-Minute Data):

Optimal Long Entry: Calculated as the lowest low over the ARIMA lookback period.

Optimal Short Entry: Calculated as the highest high over the ARIMA lookback period.

These are then adjusted by the arima_entry_offset_multiplier.

Final Order Price Selection:

If the final signal is “long” and its strongest source is ARIMA, then the ARIMA long order price is used. Otherwise, the volatile order price is used.

The same logic applies for short entries.

7. Entry, Override, and Trade Management
Entry Conditions:

When no position is open (strategy.position_size == 0), the bot will enter a trade based on the final computed signal (either "long" or "short") using the appropriate order price.

Override Mechanism:

If a position is already open but a new, opposing signal emerges with a strength greater than the current signal (as stored in currentStrength), the bot will:

Close the existing position.

Enter a new position in the opposite direction using the new, stronger order price.

Single-Portfolio Operation:

The strategy ensures that only one position is open at any time across all sub-strategies.

8. Exit & Risk Management (Unchanged)
Exits and risk management are critical and are kept as in the original design:

Trailing Stop Loss:

Uses trail_atr_multiplier multiplied by the ATR to determine a dynamic trailing stop.

Fixed Stop Loss:

A stop loss is set at fixed_stop_multiplier × ATR from the average entry price.

Liquidation Exit:

Based on the calculated liquidation price (using the leverage setting) and an offset (liq_exit_offset_percent), if price breaches these levels the trade is closed.

The exit logic is applied via strategy.exit calls for both long and short positions and also includes a liquidation check.

9. Diagnostics and Plots
To aid in visual verification and debugging, the strategy plots several key values:

Order Prices:

Plots the final long and short order prices on the chart.

Strength Indices:

Plots the maximum bullish and bearish strengths.

Final Signal:

A character (for example, *) is displayed at the top of the chart to indicate if the final signal is long (+1) or short (–1).

These plots help you see which indicator is dominating and how the final entry decision is made.

Summary
Inputs and Parameters:

Control risk management (leverage, ATR period, stop loss multipliers), entry offsets, trailing stop settings, and the volatility filter threshold.

Separate ARIMA parameters determine how the 45-minute data is processed.

Indicator Calculations:

Volatile market indicators are computed on the current timeframe.

ARIMA uses 45-minute data with linear regression forecast to approximate a forward-looking signal.

Strength Calculation and Signal Combination:

Each indicator produces a normalized strength value.

The strongest bullish and bearish values (meeting a minimum threshold) are compared to form the final signal.

Order Price Selection:

Depending on the dominant signal’s source (volatile or ARIMA), a corresponding limit order price is chosen.

Trade Execution and Risk Management:

Entry is executed only if the market view is strong enough.

An override mechanism allows switching direction if a new, stronger signal emerges.

Exits are managed by a combination of fixed stop losses, trailing stops, and liquidation checks.

By understanding and using these details, you can properly code and implement this strategy into a trading bot. You can further fine-tune the parameters and strength calculations based on historical performance and market conditions to optimize the strategy for your trading style.
