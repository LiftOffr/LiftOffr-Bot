While the TCN + CNN + LSTM combination is already powerful, there are additional architectures and modifications you might consider depending on your specific needs:

Transformer-Based Architectures:

Why Consider Them? Transformers, particularly with their self-attention mechanisms, have shown excellent performance in handling long-range dependencies and capturing complex patterns in sequential data. They often require less sequential processing than RNNs (like LSTM) because they process all time steps in parallel.

Pros: They can model relationships between all time points, not just adjacent or sequential ones, and have been successfully used in advanced forecasting tasks (e.g., Temporal Fusion Transformers).

Cons: They usually come with higher computational cost and may require larger amounts of data and careful tuning.

GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) Branch:

Why Consider Them? GRUs offer similar capabilities to LSTMs with potentially fewer parameters and slightly lower computational overhead.

Pros: They may train faster and generalize well when you have less training data.

Cons: The performance improvements compared to LSTM are often task-dependent.

Attention Mechanisms:

Integration: You might also add an attention mechanism—either as part of the LSTM branch or as a separate branch. Attention helps the model learn which parts of the sequence are most relevant at any given time, and it can dynamically weigh information.

Benefits: This can be particularly useful in volatile markets where the importance of recent versus older information can quickly change.

Hybrid or Ensemble Methods:

Idea: Instead of simply concatenating the outputs of the three branches, you could consider more advanced fusion techniques such as gating mechanisms (which learn to weight each branch’s contribution) or even ensembling predictions from separately trained sub-models.

Benefits: A well-designed fusion layer can adapt the overall model to emphasize the branch that is most informative in a given market regime.

Recommendations for Implementation in a Trading Bot
For a live trading system, you should consider the following when deciding on your architecture:

Latency and Inference Time:
In live trading, every millisecond can count. A transformer or an overly complex ensemble might offer marginal gains in prediction accuracy but could increase latency. Make sure that any additional branches are optimized for fast inference.

Robustness and Interpretability:
Multiple branches mean more components to debug. Ensure that you have appropriate logging and monitoring in place so you can analyze which branch is driving the final prediction. This can help in tailoring risk controls if one branch starts to perform poorly.

Data Volume and Quality:
More sophisticated models like transformers generally need more data to avoid overfitting. For volatile markets, ensure that your data pre-processing is robust, including outlier handling, normalization, and latency minimization.

Retraining and Adaptation:
Markets are non-stationary, especially in volatile environments. Consider using online learning or periodic retraining. An architecture with multiple branches could be combined with an attention-based gating mechanism that dynamically weighs each branch’s contribution depending on the current market regime.

Final Thoughts
The combination of a TCN branch, a CNN branch, and an LSTM branch is a strong starting point for a multi-view trading model because it brings together complementary strengths. However, many practitioners find that including a transformer branch or explicitly incorporating attention mechanisms can further boost performance—especially if you have the computational resources and data quality to support such models.

Ultimately, the “best” architecture depends on your specific market, your latency and computational requirements, and how well the model performs in backtests and live trading situations. Experimenting with the suggested alternatives (and possibly combining them in a multi-branch ensemble) may yield further improvements in performance and robustness in volatile market conditions.
