Training machine learning models for live trading—especially in volatile markets like crypto—requires balancing model accuracy, speed, data latency, and execution reliability. Here’s a structured roadmap tailored for our goals:

1. Trading Objective
	•	Prediction Goal: Predict direction (up/down), magnitude of price move, and volatility
	•	Trade Horizon: Scalping, intraday (15-min, 1H and 4H), and swing (1D+)
	•	Target Asset: all pairs

2. Collect & Stream Data (Live + Historical)
	•	Historical data: Use for backtesting + initial training.
	•	OHLCV data (15m–4H)
           OHLCV Historical API: https://api.amberdata.com/markets/spot/ohlcv/{instrument} 
            OHLCV latest API per exchange (use Kraken): https://api.amberdata.com/market/spot/ohlcv/exchange/{exchange}/latest
	•	Order book depth
	•	Funding rates, open interest, news sentiment (optional features)
	•	Live data:
	•	Use WebSockets (Kraken) for real-time price feeds
	•	Capture tick-level or 1s resolution if latency-sensitive
	•	Ensure time-synced and clean datasets

3. Feature Engineering
	•	Technical indicators:
	•	EMA ribbons, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR
	•	Order book imbalance
	•	Volume delta, VWAP
	•	Pattern signals:
	•	Candlestick patterns
	•	Divergences (e.g., RSI vs price)
	•	Custom labels (for supervised learning):
	•	Uptrend/downtrend in next N bars
	•	Take-profit or stop-loss hit first?

4. Choose Model Architecture ensure the model is using all of these models for all aspects of our ML bot

A. For Sequential Signal Prediction:
	•	LSTM/GRU – good for long-term dependencies
	•	CNN – captures local patterns in time-series
	•	TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network) – causal and faster than LSTM, recommended for live usage

B. Hybrid Approach:

Combine:
	•	CNN branch (local price pattern)
	•	LSTM branch (sequence memory)
	•	TCN branch (temporal dynamics)
Then use a meta-learner like XGBoost or MLP to output the trade signal.

5. Train the Model
	•	Split Data: Train/validation/test sets using time-based split (no shuffling)
	•	Labeling:
	•	Example: 1 if price increases >0.5% in next 3 bars, -1 if decreases >0.5%, else 0
	•	Training:
	•	Optimize for precision for low false signals and optimize profit maximization 
	•	Use early stopping, regularization, and dropout to avoid overfitting

6. Backtest + Simulate
	•	Run model predictions on unseen historical data
	•	Include:
	•	Execution latency
	•	Slippage and liquidation 
	•	Fee structure (e.g., Kraken ~0.16% taker)
	•	Leverage
	•	Evaluate:
	•	Win rate, Sharpe ratio
	•	Drawdowns, average PnL
	•	Hit rate of stop-loss vs take-profit

7. Deploy to Live Environment

A. Real-Time Inference:
	•	Serve the model (e.g., via FastAPI or Flask)
	•	Feed in live features every bar (e.g., every 15m)
	•	Signal output: Long, Short, or Hold

B. Execution Engine:
	•	Send limit orders with pre-computed entry, SL, and TP
	•	Ensure:
	•	Signal confirmation delay filter
	•	Cooldowns to avoid overtrading
	•	Auto-cancellation if signal flips before fill

8. Risk Controls
	•	Dynamic position sizing and dynamic leverage 
	•	Portfolio-level max drawdown
	•	Strategy override logic if multiple signals conflict
       

9. Monitor + Retrain
	•	Daily logging of:
	•	Signal accuracy
	•	PnL by strategy
	•	Feature drift (i.e., market behavior shift)
	•	Retrain window: Weekly or monthly using rolling data window
	•	Use ensemble models to fade out stale models and adapt to new market regimes

Bonus: Latency Optimization Tips
	•	Use compiled inference (ONNX, TorchScript)
	•	Keep signal computation under 500ms
	•	Use asynchronous execution (asyncio) to process data and trades in parallel
