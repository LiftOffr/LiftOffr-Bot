  - Advanced moving averages (multiple periods, relative positions)
  - Oscillators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic) with multiple timeframes
  - Volatility metrics (ATR, Bollinger Bands) at different scales
  - Momentum indicators with normalization
  - Multiple crossover signals across different timeframes
  - Candlestick pattern recognition features

  - Volume-price divergence indicators

### 3. Advanced Training Methodology
- **Data Augmentation**:
  - Random noise addition for robustness
  - Time scaling for improved generalization
  - Combined augmentation techniques to increase dataset size

- **Multi-Class Prediction**:
  - 5-class prediction system (strong down, moderate down, neutral, moderate up, strong up)
  - More granular signals for confidence-based trading
  - Better risk management through signal strength

- **Improved Optimization Strategy**:
  - Lower learning rate for more stable training
  - Learning rate reduction on plateau
  - Early stopping with patience for optimal performance
  - Model checkpointing to save best weights

- **Enhanced Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Class-wise accuracy reporting
  - Directional accuracy for trading decisions
  - Signal distribution analysis
  - Confusion metrics for trading performance

### 4. Risk Management Improvements
- **Dynamic Portfolio Risk**:
  - Maximum 25% portfolio risk across all positions
  - Available risk calculation for new trades
  - Risk budgeting based on open positions

- **Dynamic Position Sizing**:
  - Calculates maximum position size based on available risk
  - Adjusts trade size based on current portfolio state
  - Considers volatility in position sizing

- **Leverage Optimization**:
  - Dynamic leverage between 5x-75x based on prediction confidence
  - Higher confidence trades get more aggressive leverage
  - Conservative leverage for uncertain predictions

## Training Process Improvements

The training process has been significantly enhanced:

1. **Longer Sequence Length**: Increased from 60 to 120 bars for better pattern recognition
2. **More Training Data**: Using longer historical datasets with data augmentation
3. **Advanced Technical Features**: More than 40 indicators vs previous ~20
4. **Model Complexity**: Deeper architecture with more sophisticated components
5. **Multi-Class Prediction**: 5 classes instead of 3 for more nuanced trading
6. **Enhanced Training Regime**: Better optimization strategy with learning rate scheduling
7. **More Robust Evaluation**: Advanced metrics for trading performance

## Expected Performance Improvements

These enhancements are expected to deliver:

1. **Higher Prediction Accuracy**: More sophisticated architecture should improve basic accuracy
2. **Better Direction Accuracy**: More important for trading than raw classification accuracy
3. **Improved Win Rate**: Critical metric for trading profitability
4. **More Conservative Trading**: Better risk management with 25% portfolio risk limit
5. **More Nuanced Signals**: 5-class system allows for better position sizing and risk management
6. **Better Market Adaptation**: More features help the model understand different market regimes

The system has been redesigned to prioritize trading performance metrics (win rate, direction accuracy) over raw classification accuracy, with a strong emphasis on risk management through the 25% portfolio risk limit.

All 10 cryptocurrency pairs can now be trained with these improvements, potentially leading to substantial performance gains across the entire trading system.
